# Design Document - TicketFlow Dynamic Pricing Platform

## Overview

TicketFlow is a sophisticated event ticketing platform that implements intelligent dynamic pricing algorithms to optimize revenue while providing fair pricing to customers. The system automatically adjusts ticket prices based on three key factors: time until event, booking velocity, and remaining inventory.

## Architecture Decisions

### Monorepo Structure with Turborepo

**Decision**: Use Turborepo for managing the monorepo with separate packages for database, pricing engine, and shared configurations.

**Rationale**: 
- Enables code sharing between frontend and backend
- Maintains clear separation of concerns
- Facilitates independent testing and deployment
- Leverages Turborepo's intelligent caching for faster builds

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Better code organization and reusability
- ✅ Shared TypeScript types and utilities
- ❌ Slightly more complex initial setup
- ❌ Requires understanding of workspace dependencies

### Database Layer: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL

**Decision**: Use Drizzle ORM instead of Prisma or TypeORM for database operations.

**Rationale**:
- Type-safe SQL queries with excellent TypeScript integration
- Lightweight and performant
- Better control over SQL generation
- Excellent migration system
- Works well with PostgreSQL's advanced features

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Superior type safety and performance
- ✅ More control over generated SQL
- ❌ Smaller ecosystem compared to Prisma
- ❌ Steeper learning curve for complex queries

### Dynamic Pricing Algorithm

**Decision**: Implement a weighted multi-factor pricing system with configurable rules.

**Algorithm Design**:
```typescript
currentPrice = basePrice × (1 + weightedAdjustments)

where weightedAdjustments = 
  (timeAdjustment × 0.4) + 
  (demandAdjustment × 0.3) + 
  (inventoryAdjustment × 0.3)
```

**Rationale**:
- **Time-based (40% weight)**: Rewards early booking, penalizes last-minute purchases
- **Demand-based (30% weight)**: Responds to booking velocity, creates urgency
- **Inventory-based (30% weight)**: Scarcity pricing, maximizes revenue on limited tickets

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Highly configurable and testable
- ✅ Balances multiple pricing factors
- ✅ Prevents extreme price fluctuations
- ❌ Complex to tune optimally
- ❌ May require A/B testing for optimal weights

### Concurrency Control Strategy

**Decision**: Use PostgreSQL row-level locking with database transactions to prevent overselling.

**Implementation**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM events WHERE id = ? FOR UPDATE;
-- Check availability
-- Create booking
-- Update inventory
COMMIT;
```

**Rationale**:
- Database-level locking is the most reliable approach
- PostgreSQL's MVCC handles concurrent reads efficiently
- Transactions ensure atomicity
- Row-level locking minimizes lock contention

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Guarantees no overselling
- ✅ Database handles complexity
- ✅ Works with any number of concurrent users
- ❌ Slightly higher database load
- ❌ Potential for brief lock contention

### API Design: NestJS with RESTful Endpoints

**Decision**: Use NestJS for the API layer with traditional REST endpoints.

**Rationale**:
- Excellent TypeScript support and decorators
- Built-in validation and transformation
- Modular architecture with dependency injection
- Easy to test and maintain
- Familiar patterns for developers

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Excellent developer experience
- ✅ Built-in features (validation, guards, pipes)
- ✅ Easy to extend and maintain
- ❌ More opinionated than Express
- ❌ Larger bundle size

### Frontend: Next.js 15 with App Router

**Decision**: Use Next.js 15 with the new App Router for the frontend.

**Rationale**:
- Server-side rendering for better SEO and performance
- App Router provides better file-based routing
- Built-in API routes (though we use separate API)
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Great developer experience

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Excellent performance and SEO
- ✅ Modern React patterns
- ✅ Great developer experience
- ❌ App Router is still relatively new
- ❌ Learning curve for new patterns

## Concurrency Problem Solution

### The Challenge
When multiple users attempt to book the last available ticket simultaneously, the system must ensure only one booking succeeds to prevent overselling.

### Solution Architecture

1. **Database Transaction with Row Locking**:
   ```typescript
   await db.transaction(async (tx) => {
     // Lock the event row for update
     const [event] = await tx
       .select()
       .from(events)
       .where(eq(events.id, eventId))
       .for('update')
       .limit(1);
     
     // Check availability
     if (availableTickets < requestedQuantity) {
       throw new BadRequestException('Not enough tickets');
     }
     
     // Create booking and update inventory atomically
     // ... booking creation and inventory update
   });
   ```

2. **Automated Testing**:
   ```typescript
   it('prevents overbooking of last ticket', async () => {
     // Create event with 1 ticket
     // Make 2 simultaneous booking requests
     // Verify exactly 1 succeeds, 1 fails
   });
   ```

### Why This Approach Works

- **Atomicity**: All operations succeed or fail together
- **Isolation**: Row locking prevents concurrent modifications
- **Consistency**: Database constraints ensure data integrity
- **Durability**: Committed changes are permanent

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- **Indexes**: On frequently queried columns (event_id, user_email, created_at)
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse database connections
- **Query Optimization**: Use Drizzle's query builder efficiently

### Caching Strategy
- **Pricing Calculations**: Cache results for 30 seconds
- **Event Data**: Cache frequently accessed events
- **Future Enhancement**: Redis for distributed caching

### Frontend Performance
- **Server Components**: Reduce client-side JavaScript
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js automatic image optimization
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic with Next.js App Router

## Security Measures

### API Security
- **Input Validation**: Class-validator for all inputs
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Drizzle ORM parameterized queries
- **CORS Configuration**: Restrict to frontend domain
- **API Key Authentication**: For admin endpoints

### Data Protection
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data in .env files
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript prevents many runtime errors
- **Database Constraints**: Foreign keys and data validation

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- **Stateless API**: Can run multiple instances
- **Database**: PostgreSQL supports read replicas
- **Load Balancing**: Standard load balancer configuration

### Future Enhancements
- **Redis Caching**: For high-traffic scenarios
- **Message Queues**: For async processing
- **CDN**: For static assets
- **Microservices**: Split into smaller services

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- **Pricing Engine**: Test all pricing rules independently
- **API Services**: Mock dependencies, test business logic
- **Coverage Target**: 70%+ for critical paths

### Integration Tests
- **Database Operations**: Test with real database
- **API Endpoints**: Test complete request/response cycles
- **Pricing Integration**: Test pricing with real data

### E2E Tests
- **Concurrency Tests**: Verify overselling prevention
- **User Flows**: Complete booking process
- **Error Handling**: Test failure scenarios

## Monitoring and Observability

### Logging
- **Structured Logging**: JSON format for easy parsing
- **Request Tracing**: Track requests across services
- **Error Tracking**: Capture and alert on errors

### Metrics
- **Business Metrics**: Bookings, revenue, pricing changes
- **Technical Metrics**: Response times, error rates
- **Database Metrics**: Query performance, connection usage

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- **Local Development**: Docker Compose for services
- **Hot Reloading**: Both frontend and backend
- **Database Migrations**: Automated with Drizzle

### Production
- **Containerization**: Docker containers for all services
- **Environment Management**: Separate configs per environment
